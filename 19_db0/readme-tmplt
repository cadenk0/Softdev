DISCOVERIES:
----------------------------------------------------
* csv.DictReader() automatically puts the read CSV file in a list of dicitonaries
* Setting the list from csv.DictReader() to a list defined outside the with statement does allow the list to be used outside the with statement more than once?
* You can index dictionaries in f'strings
* if you use "" for f'strings then quotes within the string must be ''
====================================================
